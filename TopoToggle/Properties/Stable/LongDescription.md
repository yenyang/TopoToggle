## Full Description
Adds a small draggable UI panel with a button for toggling contour lines for the game and editor. This panel is available while using any tool, but not photo mode. 
First run in the game and editor, the panel starts in top left corner. Move it to where you want, the panel position will be saved and the editor and game panel positions are saved seperately.

Hides vanilla contour line toggle for vanilla tools that normally support toggling contour lines.

Option to hide Topo Toggle panel if you only want to use the keybind.

Option to replace the "TOPO" title in the panel with the elevation of the cursor on the terrain surface.

Mod uses the same keyboard shortcut as vanilla, and the keyboard shortcut may be used even if the panel is hidden.

## While using other mods:
While plopping Platter parcels, the Topo Toggle panel will be hidden, and Platter will control the toggle.

Custom tools will need to detect this mod to support hiding duplicate contour toggles or this mod can hide it's panel and effects while their custom tool is active.
